#User Stories from an Architects Perspective

As an architect, the models I use range from the spatial to construction detail, though the same requirements tend to apply. Some of my requirements for a 3D standard would be:


##Scale Units
to ensure a model is viewed correctly, it is important for the model to display at an agreed default scale (of metric based measurements) or at least indicated somewhere its units in meters or millimeters. With a way to measure and display values.


##Annotation of 3D Space
In both client and internal meetings, we often annotate 3D models during the discussion. Both, upon the geometry's surface in the case of choosing materials and identifying detail junctions for revision. Also, we tend to indicate in volumetric 3D space where objects are to be added or further modeling is required.


##How a Model is Viewed Initially
The initial view of a model is important. Defining the position and orientation of a model is important for a curated experience. It establishes the intended approach for interaction with the model. 

For example: If the initial camera is at eye-level (1.6 meters above ground) and 'close' to a building model, it implies the intention is to view the model in the first person and interrogated accordingly.

If the model first appears from an aerial view, it is implied that it is to be viewed at a distance, in relation to its context or as a holistic design model.


##Navigation About a Model
Relating to the Model View previously mentioned. I tend to use two modes of navigation about a model:
1) 'Overview' For design as an object isolated in 3D space.
2) 'Interrogation' Switching to the first person or positioned camera to experience spaces, discover sight lines, examine junction details etc.


##Spatial Relationships
It is important for me, being able to coordinate two or more models relative in 3D space, with position and orientation (assuming scale is preserved) and have that coordinate information persist within the model. To relate to separate parts that come together during construction/later design.


##Slice
Having the ability to slice the model to see internal structures or concentric spaces is important to allow the understanding of certain relationships between spaces.
